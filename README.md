👕 Cloth Condition Classifier 🤖
⭐️ Project Overview
This repository hosts a Python-based Artificial Intelligence model designed to predict the condition of clothing. Leveraging Transfer Learning with a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN), the model classifies an image of a garment into one of two categories:

✅ Good-Condition

❌ Torn/Damaged

It's a practical application of computer vision to automate quality control or inventory assessment.
